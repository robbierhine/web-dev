        <section class="column-one"><em>Column 1:</em> The first phase of ASB’s career, which I have named the Early Fashion Career, began when ASB graduated from Central Saint Martins in 1998, freeing her from what she characterizes as an unsupportive educational environment that did not foster critical thinking (Sundberg, “ Take the Ugly and Make it Nice”). With no job offer upon graduation and little desire to work for someone else, she began working on her namesake label ‘Ann-Sofie Back,’ which debuted its inaugural ready-to-wear collection during the Paris Fashion Week Spring/Summer 2002 cycle, going on to find immediate interest from niche boutiques like Pineal Eye in London, who bought her entire debut collection (Chang “The Subtleties of Cross-dressing”).</section>
        <section class="column-two"><em>Column 2: ‘Ann-Sofie Back’ Spring/Summer 2004 Ready-to-Wear</em>
      ASB’s conceptual interests and critical fashion design framework during this period are best observed through the ‘Ann-Sofie Back’ Spring/Summer 2004 Ready-to-Wear collection. Titled Trans, the collection explores femininity and expectations of femininity through the figure of the transvestite (Back, Ann-Sofie Back, 89) (make a footnote about the term transvestites). Discussing her Butlerian intrigue with transvestites with Patty Chang during an interview for Fashion Projects, ASB states that she found inspiration from the “cliched signs that transvestites use to become women: a blonde wig, fishnet stockings, a trench coat, etc,” going on to say that “[i]t's like a "woman-mask" that is more woman than a real woman” (Chang “The Subtleties of Cross-dressing”). ASB’s interest in transvestites also comes from her personal relationship to “traditional femininity,” writing in the Go As You Please catalog that she wanted to look at sexiness through “a very superficial,” which transvestites offer due to their “total disregard for “natural” beauty.” (Back, Ann-Sofie Back, 89) Conceptually, transvestites align closely with ASB’s underlying interests in performance through fashion and with failed glamour. Transvestites perform an ideal of femininity by wearing traditionally feminine clothing that often embodies an ideal of femininity that, to ASB, is often linked with sex appeal. Simultaneously, the unconvincing crossdresser, who is sussed out to be a man in women’s clothing, embodies failed glamour and the inability to reach societal standards of gender and fashion. In this way, ASB’s overarching design ethos and interest in a conceptual approach to fashion guide her toward specific subject matter, like transvestism, that ASB can then use as a tool to critique traditional notions of gender and the expectations of femininity, much like a conceptual visual artist would.</section>
