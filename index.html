    <h2 id="section-one">Early Life</h2>
            <h3>1999-2005</h3>
        <p>Robert was born at a very young age in Asheville, North Carolina. He was <em>10.2 lbs</em>, which resulted in his mother suffering from a hernia and a nurse having to break his baby collarbone in order to squeeze him out of the birth canal. Despite this troubled beginning, Robert was a quiet child who hardly ever cried.<sup>1</sup></p>
        <p>At just 18 months, he began sleepwalking - a condition that would continue into his college years.</p>
        <p>In middle school, Robert began playing the Tuba, turning into a deep passion that would lead him down an illustrious music career.</p>

    <h2 id="section-two">Career</h2>
            <h3>2006-2021</h3>
        <p>After completing high school, Robert was scouted by Icelandic musician, <em>Björk</em>, who saw him performing in a polka band and begged him to join her brass ensemble on the <i>Voltaic</i> tour for her sixth studio album <i>Volta</i>.</p>
        <p>Robert toured with Björk for nine months until he caught the attention of <em>Kelly Rowland</em>, who had just begun working on her experimental brass chamber album. In an interview with <em>People Magazine</em>, Rowland told Ryan Secreast that "[Robert's] fingering and blowing skills were unlike any tubist [she] had ever witnessed before" and that she "simply had to have him on the album."<sup>2</sup></p>
        <p>Together, Rowland and Rhinehart's album <i>Simply Brass</i> topped the Billboard Top 100 for 36 consecutive weeks and went on to beat out Rowland's former band-mate <em>Beyoncé's</em> <i>I am Sasha Fierce</i> for Album of the Year at the 2009 Grammy's.</p>
        <p>Robert would go on to work for a multitude of artists including:
            <ul>
                <li><em>Susan Boyle</em></li>
                <li><em>Charli XCX</em></li>
                <li><em>HRH Collection</em></li>
                <li><em>Madonna</em></li>
                <li><em>Tate McRae</em></li>
                <li><em>Timbaland</em></li>
            </ul>
        </p>

    <h2 id="section-three">Scandals</h2>
            <h3>2021-2052</h3>
        <p>The high of success was short lived, after it was discovered that Robert had been using illegal lip enhancers in order to achieve his signature angelic Tuba timbre. Lip enhacers were banned in competitive use by the <em>International Tuba Coalition (ITC)</em> after the 1978 tragedy in Ottawa.<sup>3</sup></p>
        <p>Rhinehart refuted these allegations, stating that his lips were sculpted by God herself in order for him to play Tuba. Nonetheless, the ITC stripped him of his Tuba license and soon after both Björk and Rowland publically disavowed him.</p>
        <p>Retreating from public life, Rhinehart was never heard from until his rather melodramatic death in 2052.</p>

    <h2 id="section-four">Death</h2>
        <p>After his fall from grace, Robert used the money he'd earned from album sales to purchase a castle in <em>Triglav National Park</em> in <em>Slovenia</em>.<sup>4</sup></p>
        <p>Refusing to accept that his stardom has ended, Robert hired an up-and-coming Tuba star to help create his mangum opus. The young musician believed he could manipulate Robert through a sordid love affair, but he was very wrong.</p>
        <p>After a particuarly harsh fight, where the young musician called Robert an old, washed up queen, Robert, attempting to throw his lover over the bannister, fell into the bell of his <em>Getzen G/CB-50</em>, dying on impact.<sup>5</sup></p>
